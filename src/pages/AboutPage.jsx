            <p>
              I grew up in Nelspruit, Mpumalanga, and graduated from HoÃ«rskool
              Bergvlam in 2016. In 2017, during my gap year, I completed a
              feature writing course. I then pursued a BCom Degree in Business
              Management, graduating cum laude in 2020. I entered the business
              world as a data administrator but felt creatively unfulfilled. In
              my free time, I explored free trial coding courses on Codecademy.
              After completing an HTML and CSS intro-course, I developed a
              strong interest in front-end and started seeing websites in a new
              light. I decided to take a year off to focus on a full Front-end
              Engineer course, which I completed during that year, during which
              my passion grew as I continued learning JavaScript and React. My
              knowledge is still expanding as I still intend to explore more
              front-end technologies and frameworks.

                  I grew up in an Afrikaans household and attended English
                  schools, allowing me to speak fluently in both languages.
                  Currently, I am excited for a new adventure as I recently moved to
                  Cape Town with my husband and our 3 fur-kids. I always try to
                  approach life with curiosity, honesty and a good sense of
                  humor, ensuring life is always interesting.
