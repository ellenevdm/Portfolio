              Pawfectly Pampered was the first website I created from scratch as
              a project for my course. It is built using only HTML and CSS. I
              enjoyed building this website as I explored more CSS features and
              experimented with them. The idea of the project was to create a
              business landing page, and I chose a pet store as I am a big
              animal lover.

                and attention to detail. I Incorporated color theory by using
                complementary colors of shades of blue and brown.

              Readit-Hub is a simplified version of Reddit designed as a
              read-only platform. Unlike Reddit, Readit-Hub doesn't require user
              authentication and only displays the top subreddits, posts, and
              comments without allowing user interaction. This web application
              was built using the Reddit API snoowrap, integrated with Redux for
              state management. Basic styling was achieved with Bootstrap. The
              primary goal of Readit-Hub was to enhance my skills in working
              with Redux and APIs.
